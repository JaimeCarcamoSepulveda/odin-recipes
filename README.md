# odin-recipes
a basic recipe website

In this odin lesson I will demonstrate my ability to create a website with multiple pages and links. I do intend to add a few mouth-watering pictures. These links will be both relative and absolute links connecting to other pages within its directory as well as outgoing links to other websites. After navigating the website the viewer should have a better idea on both recipes and ingredients needed in order to execute them.
